          <h2>Let the player see your library.</h2>
          <h3>1. Create or select your Developer app</h3>
          <p>Open the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard">Spotify Developer dashboard ↗</a> in your usual browser. Create or select your app, enable Web API access, and register this exact Redirect URI:</p>
          <Code label="Redirect URI">http://127.0.0.1:43821/callback</Code>
          <p>Save the dashboard changes. If its User Management page requires an allowlist, add the Spotify account you’ll sign in with. Copy the public <strong>client ID</strong> from the app’s settings. You don’t need its client secret.</p>
          <h3>2. Save the client ID, then sign in</h3>
          <p>Replace <code>YOUR_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID</code> below with that ID. Don’t use the app name or client secret.</p>
          <Code label="Connect your library">{`~/.local/bin/spotify-tui setup --client-id YOUR_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID &&
~/.local/bin/spotify-tui login`}</Code>
          <p>Keep the terminal command running. Your normal browser opens Spotify’s consent page. Approve access and let it return to the local callback on <strong>this computer</strong>. Login should finish within five minutes.</p>
          <p className="setup-note">You’re done when the terminal says: <samp>Signed in for library/search. Soloist pairing is separate.</samp> Audio comes next.</p>
          <details><summary>Browser didn’t open, or verification failed?</summary>
            <p>Use a normal browser outside an embedded app. Run the command below, then open the printed URL on this same computer. If five minutes have passed, start a fresh login command for a new URL.</p>
            <Code label="Open sign-in manually">~/.local/bin/spotify-tui login --no-browser</Code>
            <p>If Spotify rejects the callback, check <code>http://127.0.0.1:43821/callback</code> matches the saved dashboard URI exactly, including the port and path. Don’t replace <code>127.0.0.1</code> with <code>localhost</code>.</p>

          <h3>1. Download the official audio engine</h3>
          <InstallSoloist />
          <h3>2. Connect Soloist to this player</h3>
          <p>This adds the Soloist path to the configuration you saved in step 2. It keeps your client ID.</p>
          <Code label="Set audio engine path">~/.local/bin/spotify-tui setup --soloist-path "$HOME/.local/lib/spotify-soloist/soloist"</Code>
          <h3>3. Store your personal key</h3>
          <p>Generate your <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/soloist">personal Soloist key ↗</a> while signed in to your Premium account. Run the next command and paste the key into its <strong>hidden terminal prompt</strong>, then press Enter. Nothing is shown while you type.</p>
          <Code label="Store audio key">~/.local/bin/spotify-tui provider-key</Code>
          <p>Keep the key private. Don’t put it in a command argument, screenshot, chat or this website. The public client ID from step 2 and this private key are different things.</p>
          <h3>4. Start the engine and pair once</h3>
          <Code label="Start local audio">~/.local/bin/spotify-tui connect</Code>
          <ol>
            <li>Open the official Spotify app on this computer or another device on the same local network, signed in to the same account.</li>
            <li>Open its device picker and select <strong>Spotify TUI Local</strong>. Keep the helper running while you do this.</li>
            <li>Back in the terminal, check the connection:</li>
          </ol>
          <Code label="Check pairing">~/.local/bin/spotify-tui doctor</Code>
          <p>Look for <code>Provider connected: true paired: true</code>. A fresh engine may take a moment to connect; run doctor again after it settles. The <code>Offline Spotify downloads: UNSUPPORTED</code> line is expected.</p>
          <details><summary>Spotify TUI Local isn’t in the picker?</summary>
            <p>Confirm Soloist printed its version, the key was stored, and <code>connect</code> is still running its helper. Use the same account and a shared Wi-Fi/local network. Phone USB tethering and mobile data can make discovery unreliable; try the official client on this computer for initial pairing.

          <p>
            The player starts a small tray companion when your panel has a
            StatusNotifier host. Left-click opens the TUI; the menu offers
            pause/resume, next, previous, and stop. <kbd>q</kbd> leaves music
            and tray running; <kbd>Q</kbd> stops both.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Hyprland, enable the tray component in Quickshell or your panel.
            GNOME may need an AppIndicator extension. The app doesn’t install or
            modify your panel configuration. Run <code>spotify-tui doctor</code>{" "}
            to check the host, or <code>spotify-tui --no-tray</code> to skip the
            tray. Opening from the tray requires Kitty, Foot, Alacritty,
            Konsole, GNOME Terminal or xterm.

            The app checks the latest stable release in the background when
