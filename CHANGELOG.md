<a id="v031"></a>

### v0.3.1

28 October 2026 · **Stable** · Linux x86_64

- Add the Next.js website under `next/`: glass logo, landing page, step-by-step account setup and a changelog with release detail pages.
- Keep playback restoration marked busy after an update, so keyboard requests cannot race the initial play/seek operation.
- Restore an up-to-date playback position and preserve the no-tray preference when restarting after an update.

### v0.3.0

28 October 2026 · **Stable** · Linux x86_64

- Add a Linux tray with the approved music-note logo, playback controls and an action to reopen the TUI.

- Fix pause/resume decisions using the helper's current state and wait for provider confirmation. Ignore older state snapshots.
- Publish the repository and support public downloads without GitHub login.

### v0.2.0

28 October 2026 · **Stable** · Linux x86_64

**Intuitive navigation, Spotify colours and the first packaged Linux release**

- Move with arrows or j/k, return with Left/Esc, and open with Right/Enter. Paging stays in the focused pane; narrow terminals keep that pane visible.
- Enter starts the local player when needed. Clear request feedback, editable search and reconnect controls make everyday use easier.
- Try generic sample music with `--demo`, without signing in. Go and Rust now have their own source directories.

## Earlier planning material

The [planning-v0.1.0 bundle](https://github.com/wrestle-R/Spotify-Tui/releases/tag/planning-v0.1.0), published on 28 October 2026 in Asia/Calcutta, contains documents and a terminal concept. It is not an older player version. The first source implementation was subsequently published on main before the 0.2.x Linux release.

## Release verification

Each release page explains the tested packages, requirements, known issues and available validation evidence. The current Linux package is checksum-verified and unsigned. Offline downloads, broader provider recovery and long-session memory/stability validation remain outstanding. The repository and release downloads are public.
